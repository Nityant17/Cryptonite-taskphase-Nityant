# Pondering Paths  
- Used the `ssh -i key hacker@pwn.college` command in the terminal to establish connection between the terminal and [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/)

## The Root

- Thought Process: Need to run a program "pwn" so have to provide the path to the program.  
- Solution: Start the challenge, input the command `/pwn` to provide the absolute path to the program "pwn" and run the program.
