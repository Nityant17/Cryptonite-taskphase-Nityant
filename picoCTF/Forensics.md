**Flag:** `picoCTF{beep_boop_im_in_space}`

Approach:

- **Step 1**

I started by downloading the file and saw it was a .wav file which means it was an audio file and knew we had to use a certain decoder for it, then i saw the hints and researched a bit about them by using my trusty companion chatGPT and found out that we needed to use a SSTV decoder for it with an RX setting set to something related to Scottish Dog.

- step 2

I tried really hard to find an online SSTV decoder but was unable to find one ultimatley i downloaded a mobile app which had the decoder and played the audio on my laptop and let the app do the magic while my ears bled, and thus i got the picture with the flag!!!

The picture was a bit unclear but i was able to guess the "im" and "in" part

Knowledge Gained:

1. How did pictures from the moon landing get sent back to Earth
2. Who is the CMU mascot
3. what is SSTV method of transfer 

Incorrect Methods:

- No incorrect methods, what we needed to do was pretty straight forward
