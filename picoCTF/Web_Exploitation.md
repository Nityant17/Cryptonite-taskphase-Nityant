This challenge was pretty easy, it just required for us to tinker with the cookie values of the webpage, seeing the title of the challenge and webpage i knew we had to do something with the cookies so i accessed them by going to inspect, application and then cookies there i saw the value as -1 and thought to change it which resulted in a new webpage so i kept on doing this till i entered the value 18 which gave me the flag!!!

# Forbidden Paths

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`

Approach:

- **Step 1**

On launching the challenge i got a basic undertsanding of the challenge, we need to somehow enter a path in the website that could bypass the filtering of absolute path and since we cant provide a absolute path i had to do something different, so i used chatGPT to get basic ideas of how we can bypass filters like this and one method suggested was to append `../../` before `/flag.txt` to bypass the filter this is known as directory traversal. This works because basically what we are doing is moving up the directories till we reach the root directory and then we provide the relative path from there to `/flag.txt` so i just kept appending `../` till i entered `../../../../flag.txt` which worked and it gave me the flag!!!

Knowledge Gained:

1. Directory Traversal in websites
2. Basic idea on how to bypass absolute path filters

Incorrect Methods:

- Initially i tried various methods to bypass the filter like using `.`, using globs etc. which did not work so i used help of AI to get a basic idea of what to do
