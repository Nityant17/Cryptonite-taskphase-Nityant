# buffer overflow 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}`

I got the source code file so i read it and it was written that max flag size was 64 so i just entered a value way more than 64 and it overflowed and i got the flag!!!

# format string 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_c8362f05}`

Started the challenge and read the source code, didnt find anything special, now ran the challenge and it asked for us to enter the dish name now there were 3 options i entered the one which contained format specifiers (%s,d,f,etc) since challenge name is format string and it worked then again it asked for another name i again followed the same rule and got the flag!!! After solving it by luck i tried understanding why this worked so basically the condition the code was checking is that the entered answer should be greater than 64 in size but the options given were 
```
Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
```
None of these are greater than 64 but when code encounters "%114d" in "Gr%114d_Cheese" it reads it as a format specifier and expects to prints a 114 integer value there but since we havent given any value it replaces it with garbage values thus satisfying the conditon, now for the second case it asked for something that could crash the code and the options were
```
Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
```
So i enetred "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak" since it had "%s" in it which is another format specifier and we didnt give it any value so i felt that it could lead to error and crashing the site and thus i got the flag!!! ("Pe%to_Portobello" wont work since %t is not a format specifier)
