**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}`

I got the source code file so i read it and it was written that max flag size was 64 so i just entered a value way more than 64 and it overflowed and i got the flag!!!

# format string 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_c8362f05}`

Started the challenge and read the source code, didnt find anything special, now ran the challenge and it asked for us to enter the dish name now there were 3 options i entered the one which contained format specifiers (%s,d,f,etc) since challenge name is format string and it worked then again it asked for another name i again followed this and got the flag!!!
